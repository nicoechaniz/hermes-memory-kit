## [Unreleased]

### Native-first manual re-entry

- Rehydrate returns native session/goal guidance without shared handoff, disabled
  native-store, engineering-state or database reads. Legacy flags are accepted
  as deprecated no-ops; no conversation is claimed restored.
- Workspace re-entry instructions preserve current human precedence and avoid
  mandatory global-handoff startup. HMK provider and schemas are unchanged.
- Two offline regressions cover poisoned legacy paths and root-free guidance.
- This focused change leaves bootstrap defaults and installed plugins alone.

## [3.7.3] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- `hmk-memory` provider now resolves `memoryctl.py` for both bootstrapped
  layouts. Previously only the workspace layout (`<hermes_home>/../scripts/`)
  was probed; deploys using the default `~/.hermes/` (root layout, with
  `scripts/` as a child of hermes_home) would fall through to a PYTHONPATH
  lookup and fail with `No module named 'memoryctl'`. The provider now also
  probes `<hermes_home>/scripts/`. `HMK_MEMORYCTL_PATH` remains supported
  as an explicit override for non-standard deploys.
- `templates/plugins/hmk-memory/plugin.yaml` bumped to `1.0.1`.
- README of the plugin documents both layouts and the autodetection order.

Reported by Nicolás (CompAII deploy at `~/.hermes/`) — prefetch was silently
falling back to `""` for ~12 hours before the regression was caught. The
diagnosis pointed to `Path(hermes_home).parent` returning the user `$HOME`
when hermes_home is the workspace root.

## [3.7.2] — 2026-05-05

Share-readiness hardening so the kit can be cloned and used by colleagues
without environment-specific surprises. **No functional changes** to
memoryctl, the hmk-memory provider, or the dialogue-handoff plugin.

### Changed

- `scripts/full_backup.sh` moved to `examples/full_backup.example.sh`. It
  is the author's personal multi-agent backup with hardcoded
  `/home/onairam/...` paths and was misleading at the top level of a
  shareable repo. A disclaimer header is prepended; the body is verbatim.
- `requirements.txt` split into core (informational, no third-party deps —
  the kit's core uses only Python stdlib + SQLite) and a new
  `requirements-ingest.txt` for the optional `scripts/ingest_any.py`
  multi-format ingestion (beautifulsoup4, markdownify, mammoth,
  trafilatura). `requirements-local-embeddings.txt` keeps CPU-local
  embedding extras separate.
- `ISSUE-plugin-backup-collision.md` moved out of the repo root into
  `docs/known-issues/plugin-backup-collision.md`. It is a known-issue
  write-up, not a top-level concern.

### Added

- Version tags (`v3.6.0`, `v3.7.0`, `v3.7.1`, `v3.7.2`) so colleagues can
  pin to a specific release. The repo previously had no tags.

## v3.7.1 — 2026-05-02

### Fixed (critical, data-loss bug in `bootstrap_agent.py --upgrade`)

- **`bootstrap_agent.py --upgrade` no longer wipes the agent's `scripts/` directory.**
  The previous behaviour at line ~316 was
  `copy_tree_overwrite(SCRIPTS_DIR, agent_dir / "scripts", preserve_exec=True)`,
  and `copy_tree_overwrite()` does
  `shutil.rmtree(dst)` before copying. That deleted any agent-authored
  scripts (e.g. `mc_runtime.py`, `agent_state.py`, custom helpers, the
  whole `.bak` history) on every upgrade with no warning and no recovery
  path. A real deployment lost ~25 files this way during the v3.7.0
  rollout to a reference agent (recovered from off-host backup). This
  release prevents the recurrence.
- **New helper `copy_tree_merge(src, dst, *, preserve_exec, backup_dir)`**
  is the merging counterpart to `copy_tree_overwrite`. It walks `src`,
  copies each file into `dst` (overwriting collisions), and leaves files
  in `dst` that `src` does not ship untouched. When `backup_dir` is
  passed, the pre-image of every overwritten file is archived there
  before being replaced — so a botched upgrade is recoverable from disk.
- **`upgrade()` now uses `copy_tree_merge`** for `scripts/` and writes
  the pre-images into `<agent>/script-backups/scripts-merge.<ts>/`.
  Output now reports `copied=N overwritten=N preserved=N` per upgrade
  so the operator can see exactly what changed.
- **`copy_tree_overwrite` docstring** explicitly warns that it destroys
  the destination, so future callers do not accidentally re-introduce
  this class of bug. The function is still used for plugins/skills,
  where rotation is already handled by an explicit
  `shutil.move(target, plugin-backups/<name>.<ts>.bak)` step before the
  overwrite — that path was always safe.

### Smoke

A fake agent workspace upgraded with custom files in `scripts/` showed
`copied=18 overwritten=1 preserved=2`. The custom files came through
intact and the overwritten kit file was archived under
`script-backups/scripts-merge.<ts>/`.

## v3.7.0 — 2026-05-01

### New (`hmk-memory` MemoryProvider plugin)

- **`templates/plugins/hmk-memory/`** — implementation of Hermes Agent's
  formal `MemoryProvider` ABC. On every API call Hermes invokes
  `prefetch(query)` and the returned text is injected into the conversation,
  giving the LLM long-term memory it doesn't have to ask for. Companion to
  the existing `dialogue-handoff` working-memory plugin (they live in
  different planes and coexist).
- **Retriever**: defaults to `memoryctl.engram_pack` (RRF over episodic /
  semantic / procedural buckets, with per-bucket quotas). Auto-falls-back
  to `memoryctl.hybrid_pack` when ENGRAM columns are absent. Configurable
  via `HMK_PROVIDER_RETRIEVER`.
- **Render**: items come back as a `## 🧠 Memoria relevante` markdown block
  with `[engram_type|shelf]` tags when ENGRAM is active and `[shelf]` only
  when running the hybrid fallback. Each line cites `[mem:N]` for the LLM
  to use in responses.
- **`hermes hmk-memory status`** — CLI subcommand (registered only when this
  is the active provider) that prints DB path, ENGRAM presence, chapter
  counts per bucket, engram-backfill counts, and effective provider config.
- **23 pytest cases** in `tests/test_hmk_memory_provider.py` covering name,
  registration, all `is_available()` variants (no DB, only HMK_DB_PATH set,
  ENGRAM DB, legacy DB, corrupt DB), `initialize()` (defaults, env
  overrides, retriever fallback), `prefetch()` (empty query, engram_pack
  call shape, hybrid_pack fallback, empty items, exception swallowing),
  `system_prompt_block()` adaptation by retriever, and required no-op
  methods (`get_tool_schemas`, `handle_tool_call`, `get_config_schema`,
  `save_config`, `shutdown`). First pytest suite shipped by the kit.
- **`docs/memory-provider.md`** — concept, two-plane architecture (working
  vs long-term), activation, env-var contract, single-provider rule,
  performance characteristics, roadmap.

### Configuration contract

`HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` (or its legacy aliases `AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` /
`HMK_BASE_DIR`) is **mandatory** because `memoryctl.connect()` requires
BASE_DIR to resolve and `sys.exit(2)` otherwise. `HMK_DB_PATH` is documented
as an override for non-standard layouts; setting only `HMK_DB_PATH` without
a base is explicitly rejected by `is_available()` to prevent the gateway
from booting with a provider that would crash on first recall.

### Discovery

Hermes scans `__init__.py` for the strings `MemoryProvider` or
`register_memory_provider`. `plugin.yaml` carries metadata only and does
not participate in activation — `config.yaml: memory.provider: hmk-memory`
is the source of truth.

### Limitations of this MVP (deliberate)

- `sync_turn`, `on_pre_compress`, `get_tool_schemas` are no-ops. Recall is
  purely pre-emptive via `prefetch`.
- One external memory provider can be active at a time (Hermes runtime
  rule). If you have another (`mem0`, `hindsight`, `openviking`, etc.),
  pick one.

### Notes for the reference deployment

- `bootstrap_agent.py --upgrade` already copies new plugins into existing
  agents (template path: `templates/plugins/<name>/`).
- No DB migration needed for installs that don't yet use ENGRAM — the
  provider's hybrid-pack fallback covers them.

## v3.6.0 — 2026-05-01

### New (ENGRAM taxonomy)

- **`scripts/migrate-engram.py`** — idempotent schema migration that adds
  `engram_type` (`episodic`/`semantic`/`procedural` with CHECK constraint)
  plus `event_ts`, `actor`, `location_json` columns to `chapters`, with
  matching indexes. Backs up the DB to `<db>.bak.preengram.<unix_ts>`
  before any DDL. Applies a heuristic shelf→engram_type UPDATE pass
  (e.g. `mc-episodic`, `episodes` → `episodic`; `mc-skills`, `plans` →
  `procedural`; rest defaults to `semantic`).
- **`memoryctl.py engram-pack` subcommand** — Reciprocal Rank Fusion
  retrieval across the three buckets. Runs `hybrid_pack` per
  `engram_type`, then fuses the ranked lists via
  `Σ_b 1 / (k + rank_b(d))` with `k=60`. Quotas
  (`--quota-episodic`, `--quota-semantic`, `--quota-procedural`)
  guarantee a minimum number of items from each bucket before the
  remaining prompt budget is filled by RRF ranking. Each returned
  item carries its source `engram_type` so the caller can render
  bucket-aware prompt sections.
- **`engram_types` filter** propagated through `_filter_clauses_and_params`,
  `search`, `semantic_search`, and `hybrid_pack` for callers that want
  explicit single-bucket retrieval from the Python API. The CLI does not
  expose `--engram-type` directly — `engram-pack` is the typed entry point.
- **`scripts/backfill-semantic.py`** — walks every
  `engram_type='episodic'` chapter (scoped by `--shelf-pattern`, default
  `mc-%`), asks Hermes via `hermes chat -q` to extract durable facts in
  `TYPE | TEXT` format, and inserts the results as new
  `engram_type='semantic'` chapters under an auto-created
  `engram-backfill` book in the appropriate shelf. Each new chapter is
  tagged `engram-backfill`, `<fact_type>`, and `src-chapter-<source_id>`
  for traceability and easy rollback. Default prompt is generic; set
  `HMK_AGENT_NAME` and `HMK_DOMAIN_DESC` to specialize, or pass
  `--prompt-file` for a fully custom template. `--dry-run` prints
  extracted facts without writing.
- **`docs/engram.md`** — concept, schema, shelf mapping, RRF formula,
  CLI usage, backfill workflow, and the few-shot retrieval pattern used
  by the reference deployment.

### Notes for the reference deployment

- This release ports the live ENGRAM stack from the hermes-prime
  workspace (where it had been running since the Sprint 3 work on the
  Minecraft agent project) into the kit so the public repo reflects the
  shipped behavior. No data migration is required for installs that do
  not yet use ENGRAM — `engram_type` defaults to `semantic` and the new
  CLI subcommand is opt-in.

## v3.1.0 — 2026-04-23

### Fixed (critical continuity bug)

- **`_trunc()` preserves multi-line content.** Before, it did `s.splitlines()[0]` when the text had newlines, so any markdown response (tables, lists, code blocks) was reduced to its first sentence before injection. A 5,326-char response ended up as a 100-char headline. Fix: truncate by character budget, preserving newlines. Measured impact on a real session: injection grew from 458 chars to 2,464 chars (5.4×) with semantic structure intact.

### New (persistence of substantive tail)

- **`DIALOGUE-HANDOFF.md` now persists `## Recent Exchanges`** — a verbatim multi-line tail of the last N substantive turns (default N=4, cap 2000 chars per message). Written by `post_llm_call` and read by `pre_llm_call` directly, eliminating the need to reopen the session JSON on every new-session cold start.
- **Backwards-compatible**: if the handoff still lacks the Recent Exchanges block (e.g. a v3.0 handoff mid-upgrade), `pre_llm_call` falls back to the legacy tiered-JSON path. The next `post_llm_call` substantive turn upgrades the handoff to v3.1 format.

### New (anti-trivial gate)

- **`_is_substantive(user, assistant)`** threshold (default 300 chars combined) gates the Recent Exchanges update. Trivial turns like "en qué estábamos?" no longer overwrite the real conversation tail — metadata still updates (Last Turn timestamp, session_id), but the tail stays intact until a real turn arrives.

### Knobs (calibrable)

- `_SUBSTANTIVE_MIN_CHARS = 300` — below this, turn does not update tail.
- `_TAIL_EXCHANGES = 4` — how many substantive exchanges kept in handoff.
- `_TAIL_CHARS_PER_MSG = 2000` — per-message char cap in tail.

Legacy tiered knobs (`_BUDGET_CHARS`, `_TIER*_CHARS`, `_TIER3_STRIDE`) remain but are used only in the backwards-compatibility fallback path.

## v3.0.1 — 2026-04-23

### Fixed (critical)

- **`.env.template` uses absolute paths at bootstrap**. Before, rendered `.env` had `${HMK_WORKSPACE_ROOT}/hermes-home` chains that systemd `EnvironmentFile=` reads literally (systemd does NOT expand `${VAR}`). Consequence: gateway started with `HERMES_HOME=${HMK_HERMES_HOME}` string literal and failed before loading anything. Fix: template uses `{{WORKSPACE_ROOT}}` placeholder that `render_template()` replaces with the agent's absolute path — final `.env` has literal paths compatible with systemd.

### Fixed (layout)

- **`.env` canonical location moved from agent root to `hermes-home/.env`**. Hermes Agent upstream rewrites `HERMES_HOME/.env` via `os.replace()` (atomic rename) in `config.py:3292/3395/3451`. A symlink at that path would be replaced by a regular file on the first save. The new layout puts the real file in `hermes-home/.env` and a relative symlink at `agent_root/.env → hermes-home/.env`, so:
  - Hermes upstream writes to the real file; the symlink stays intact.
  - `hmk` wrapper reads from agent root (workspace) via the symlink.
  - systemd template `EnvironmentFile=%h/agents/%i/.env` resolves via the symlink.

### Fixed (UX)

- **`bootstrap_agent.py --next-steps` prints an absolute path** to the kit's systemd template (`<kit>/templates/systemd/hermes-gateway@.service`), not a relative path through the agent's `scripts/..` that does not exist (templates are not copied into agents).

### Docs

- `docs/multi-agent.md`, `docs/migration-v3.md`, and `README.md` all updated to reflect the canonical `hermes-home/.env` + inverted symlink model, with explicit references to `config.py:3292/3395/3451` as the reason for the inversion.

## v3.0.0 — 2026-04-23 (unreleased)

### Breaking

- **Repositioning**: the kit is now a scaffold for a self-contained Hermes agent, not just a memory workspace. A bootstrapped workspace includes `hermes-home/` (config, SOUL, memories, sessions, plugins, skills) alongside the existing `agent-memory/` and `wiki/`.
- **`bootstrap_workspace.py` renamed to `bootstrap_agent.py`**. The old name is kept as a deprecation shim that delegates to the new entry point. Shim may be removed in v4.
- **Canonical memory-root env var is `HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE`**. `HMK_BASE_DIR` and `AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` still work as legacy fallbacks in the cascade.
- **No more hardcoded path fallbacks**. `memoryctl.py`, `continuityctl.py`, and the `dialogue-handoff` plugin now hard-fail (exit 2 for scripts, disable-plugin for the hook) when required env vars are unset, rather than silently defaulting to `/home/onairam/agent-memory` or the repo's own `agent-memory/`. This prevents one misconfigured agent from writing over another's state.
- **`.env.template` replaces `.env.example`**. `.env.example` is kept as a symlink for one release.
- **`dialogue-handoff` plugin bumped to v3.0**. Requires `HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` (or direct `HMK_DIALOGUE_HANDOFF_PATH` / `HMK_ALWAYS_CONTEXT_PATH`) and `HMK_HERMES_HOME` (or `HMK_SESSIONS_DIR`). If unresolved, it logs an error and becomes a no-op.
- **Agent name regex**: `bootstrap_agent.py` validates names against `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`. Lowercase alphanumeric plus dash, first char not a dash. Mismatched names fail the bootstrap.
- **Auto-upgrade v2 → v3 is explicitly NOT supported**. `bootstrap_agent.py` detects a v2 layout (has `agent-memory/` but no `hermes-home/`) and refuses. See `docs/migration-v3.md` for the migration playbook.

### New

- `templates/hermes-home/` — config.yaml, SOUL.md, memories/MEMORY.md, memories/USER.md as templates with `{{AGENT_NAME}}` and `{{USER_PROFILE}}` placeholders.
- `templates/systemd/hermes-gateway@.service` — systemd user-service template, enable one instance per agent with `systemctl --user enable --now hermes-gateway@<name>.service`.
- `docs/multi-agent.md` — guide for running several agents on one host.
- `docs/migration-v3.md` — migration playbook for v2.x workspaces.

### Removed

- Default fallback paths in memoryctl, continuityctl, and dialogue-handoff. Any code path that previously fell back to `/home/onairam/agent-memory` or `$HOME/.hermes` now errors out explicitly.

### Notes for the reference deployment

- The live hermes-prime workspace on onairam-agent is still on v2.x layout as of this release. Migration scheduled for a dedicated session.

## v2.1.x — 2026-04-23

- Added ALWAYS-CONTEXT injection layer in `dialogue-handoff` plugin (1500 char budget, prepended to tiered handoff).
- Embedding benchmark harness (`embed_benchmark.py`, `embed_clear.py`, `embed_verify.py`) with provider-aware preflight.
- README reframed as "operational memory stack".

## v2.0.x — 2026-04

- `dialogue-handoff` plugin: `pre_llm_call` hook injects tiered-compressed continuity context on first turn of each new session. Never touches the system prompt.

## v1.0.0 — initial release

- `memoryctl.py` FTS5 + embeddings hybrid retrieval.
- `continuityctl.py` rehydration.
- `bootstrap_workspace.py` self-contained workspaces.
- `hmk` wrapper.
