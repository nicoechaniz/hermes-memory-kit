# Memory Provider plugin (`hmk-memory`)

Since v3.7.0 the kit ships a memory provider that implements the formal
[`MemoryProvider`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/app/agent/memory_provider.py)
ABC of Hermes Agent. This is a different extension point from the
`dialogue-handoff` plugin — they live in different planes and they coexist.

## Separate continuity and durable-memory planes

Native Hermes session history and goal state own conversational continuity.
`hmk-memory` owns durable curated recall through automatic `prefetch(query)` and
`librarian`. Neither path reads a handoff or calls continuityctl. The standalone
`dialogue-handoff` hooks are optional compatibility tooling, not a dependency.
Bootstrap installs HMK, explicitly disables dialogue, and leaves native file
stores disabled. See [native-continuity.md](native-continuity.md).

```

When ENGRAM columns are present (see `docs/engram.md`), the provider uses
`engram_pack` to fuse three per-bucket retrievals via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
(`Σ_b 1 / (k + rank_b)` with `k=60`) and per-bucket quotas. When ENGRAM is
not applied, the provider degrades to a single `hybrid_pack` call — same
output shape, no bucket distinction.

## Activation

In the agent's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
memory:
  provider: hmk-memory
  memory_enabled: false
  user_profile_enabled: false
```

Restart the gateway. Hermes' "single provider rule" means only one external
memory provider is active at a time. If another provider was active, change
this entry and restart — the old one stops, the new one initializes.

After activation, `hermes hmk-memory status` becomes available; before that,
the subcommand is hidden by Hermes' active-provider gating.

## Configuration (env-var-only)

The provider does NOT participate in `hermes memory setup` (no setup
wizard). All configuration is via env vars in the agent's `.env`. The full
table lives in the plugin's `README.md`. The mandatory variable is
`HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` — `memoryctl.connect()` requires `BASE_DIR` to
resolve, and that variable is the canonical source.

## Discovery

Hermes finds memory providers by scanning each plugin's `__init__.py` for
the strings `MemoryProvider` or `register_memory_provider`. `plugin.yaml` is
descriptive metadata, not active discovery. This means:

- A typo in `plugin.yaml` does **not** prevent activation.
- A typo in `__init__.py` (or moving `register_memory_provider` out of the
  text scan range) **does** prevent activation.
- Only the file containing the `register()` call needs to be changed when
  upgrading.

## What this provider does NOT do (yet)

The provider implements `prefetch`, `system_prompt_block`, and `librarian`.
These optional hooks of the `MemoryProvider` ABC remain no-op:

- `sync_turn` — turns are not auto-persisted as new chapters. Use the
  existing CLI ingestion path (`memoryctl add-text`, `ingest_any.py`) for
  durable writes.
- `on_pre_compress` — Hermes owns native compression and session continuity;
  this provider does not create a second dialogue summary.

Unlike those optional hooks, `get_tool_schemas` is implemented: it exposes
`librarian` for on-demand queries, expansion and curated memory operations.

These are reserved for future releases. The MVP scope was chosen so the
provider could ship behind a single configuration switch without changing
how chapters are written or compressed.

## Performance characteristics

On a CPU-only deployment with `model2vec` embeddings (kit default since
v3.4):

- First call after restart: includes embedding-model load (~5-10s of
  one-off cost).
- Steady-state `engram_pack`: ~3-10s on modern CPUs, ~10-30s on older
  hardware. The fan-out (3 hybrid passes + RRF) is the dominant cost.
- Steady-state `hybrid_pack` fallback: ~1-3s.

If latency budget is tight, set `HMK_PROVIDER_RETRIEVER=hybrid_pack` and
accept the loss of bucket balance. Future work (v3.8+) may add async /
queued prefetch for next-turn pre-warming via `queue_prefetch`.

## Roadmap

| Version | Scope |
|---|---|
| v3.7.0 (this release) | `prefetch` + `system_prompt_block` over engram_pack/hybrid_pack. Env-driven config. CLI status. |
| v3.8.x (future) | `sync_turn` (auto-persist substantive turns to `chapters` as episodic), `queue_prefetch` (async pre-warm). |
| v3.9.x (future) | `on_pre_compress` (extract durable facts from to-be-compressed messages, write as semantic chapters). |
| Implemented since the initial roadmap | `get_tool_schemas` exposes `librarian` for on-demand recall and curation. |

These are tentative — concrete scope and timing get committed when the
prior release has stabilized in production for at least a couple of weeks.
