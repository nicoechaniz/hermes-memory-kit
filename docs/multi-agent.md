# Multi-agent deployment

Hermes Memory Kit v3.0+ defaults to **one directory = one isolated installation**.
This page explains how to deploy several agents side-by-side without accidental
cross-contamination. Installation boundaries do not establish being identity.

## The rule

For each agent, everything it needs lives inside its own workspace:

```
~/agents/<name>/
├── AGENTS.md            operator-facing notes
├── .env                 symlink → hermes-home/.env (canonical)
├── hermes-home/         HERMES_HOME — config, SOUL, memories, sessions, plugins
│   └── .env             ← canonical real file (Hermes upstream writes here with os.replace)
├── agent-memory/        durable memory (library.db, state, episodes, plans, index)
├── wiki/                optional generated HMK projection (never the LLM Wiki)
├── scripts/             tooling (hmk, memoryctl, continuityctl, ...)
├── app/                 hermes-agent upstream clone (user installs)
└── venv/                Python venv for app/ (user creates)

> The `.env` is canonically located at `hermes-home/.env` because Hermes Agent
> upstream rewrites it via `os.replace()` (atomic rename) in `config.py:3292/3395/3451`
> — a symlink at that path would be replaced by a regular file on the first save.
> The symlink in the agent root is relative (`hermes-home/.env`), so both the
> `hmk` wrapper (reads from workspace root) and the systemd template
> (`EnvironmentFile=%h/agents/%i/.env`) follow it to the real file.
```

Separate installations receive separate config, SOUL, memory, sessions, plugins,
skills, library.db, wiki and scripts by default. Missing memory-path configuration
fails explicitly rather than selecting another installation's files.

An external read-only corpus can be shared deliberately. Authorized bodies of the
same being may also use an explicitly configured being-level durable-memory pool,
while keeping native sessions and body-specific configuration separate. Such
membership and access come from the runtime's authorized binding, not matching
agent names, workspace paths, models or copied SOUL files. This kit's bootstrap
does not establish those bindings or synchronize offline SQLite copies. See the
[general-memory review](general-memory-review.md).

## Bootstrapping a new agent

```bash
python3 /path/to/hermes-memory-kit/scripts/bootstrap_agent.py \
    ~/agents/hermes-alfa --name hermes-alfa --with-wiki-templates
```

Notes:
- `--name` defaults to the basename of the directory. It must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` (lowercase alphanumeric + dash, first char not a dash). The name is used as a systemd instance identifier and as the workspace basename.
- If the target already looks like a v2.x workspace (`agent-memory/` present, `hermes-home/` absent), bootstrap refuses to run and points to `docs/migration-v3.md`.
- Bootstrap does **not** clone `hermes-agent` nor create the venv. That's documented as a manual next step in the bootstrap output.

## Enabling the systemd unit

Install the template once per host, then enable one instance per agent:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp /path/to/hermes-memory-kit/templates/systemd/hermes-gateway@.service \
   ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload

systemctl --user enable --now hermes-gateway@hermes-alfa.service
systemctl --user enable --now hermes-gateway@hermes-beta.service
```

The template assumes agents live at `%h/agents/%i/`. If an agent lives somewhere else (different disk, shared mount), generate a non-template unit with absolute paths — `bootstrap_agent.py` prints a hint when the location is non-standard.

## Default path isolation

Every script in the kit checks the cascade and hard-fails if the agent's `.env` is missing or misconfigured:

| Resource | Canonical env | Legacy fallbacks | If unset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent memory root | `HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` | `AGENT_MEMORY_BASE`, `HMK_BASE_DIR` | hard fail |
| Library DB | `HMK_DB_PATH` (optional override) | derived from root | hard fail |
| Hermes home | `HMK_HERMES_HOME` | `HERMES_HOME` | hard fail for handoff plugin |
| Sessions dir | `HMK_SESSIONS_DIR` | derived from `HMK_HERMES_HOME` | hard fail |
| Handoff file | `HMK_DIALOGUE_HANDOFF_PATH` | derived from `HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` | hard fail for plugin |
| Always-context | `HMK_ALWAYS_CONTEXT_PATH` | derived from `HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE` | hard fail for plugin |
| Vault (wiki) | `HMK_VAULT_DIR` | — | derived from workspace root |

The `hmk` wrapper loads each agent's `.env` and absolutizes relative paths against `HMK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`. You never run kit commands without the wrapper unless you source the `.env` yourself.

## Running two agents on one host

```bash
# Agent 1
python3 scripts/bootstrap_agent.py ~/agents/hermes-alfa --name hermes-alfa
# fill in ~/agents/hermes-alfa/.env (API keys, SOUL, platform tokens)
cd ~/agents/hermes-alfa
git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git app
python3 -m venv venv && ./venv/bin/pip install -e ./app
systemctl --user enable --now hermes-gateway@hermes-alfa.service

# Agent 2 — identical process, different persona and tokens
python3 scripts/bootstrap_agent.py ~/agents/hermes-beta --name hermes-beta
# ...
systemctl --user enable --now hermes-gateway@hermes-beta.service
```

Both agents run in parallel as systemd user services. Under this default setup,
their sessions, memory and config are disjoint.

## What if I misconfigure `.env`?

You see an explicit error, never a silent write to another agent's tree:

```
$ python3 scripts/memoryctl.py stats
ERROR: memoryctl needs HMK_AGENT_MEMORY_BASE (canonical) or
       AGENT_MEMORY_BASE / HMK_BASE_DIR / HMK_DB_PATH in the
       environment for initializing the library DB.
```

The `dialogue-handoff` plugin logs an error and disables itself rather than falling back to a default path.

## Upgrading the kit in an existing agent

```bash
python3 /path/to/hermes-memory-kit/scripts/bootstrap_agent.py \
    ~/agents/hermes-alfa --upgrade
```

Upgrade refreshes `scripts/`, `hermes-home/plugins/`, `hermes-home/skills/`. It preserves `config.yaml`, `SOUL.md`, `memories/*`, `.env`, `library.db`, and anything the user added.

It does **not** migrate a v2.x workspace to v3 layout. See `docs/migration-v3.md` for the migration playbook.
